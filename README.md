# Audience-Measurement-Using-Digital-Video-Watermarking-and-Sentimental-Analysis

Description:
The system developed by the entertainment industry to provide
the users with required services also includes the TRP system. Considering
working upon the same lines our model provides a more efficient system to
analyze the audience watching television and thus providing them with the
right content and right amount of content. The system considers viewership of
a channel based on various factors like the frames extracted from video watermarked frames, emotion recognition of the viewer, age and gender recognition
of the viewer and based on all this data the viewed content of the specific
set of users will be modified. Thus, giving a value to the investment made
for the channels by the users as well as respecting the time-based constraint.
This system will also provide a higher security to the overall system and will
maintain the integrity of the system. Based on the complete data collected
from the users, then accordingly services will be provided thereby making an
effective and positive use of the user data and technology.
